# Carpool
Carpool is a platform which provides carpool information services to students in Tongji university.

### Why we make this
As we all know, our campus' location is relatively remote. It's located in Jiading and usually it will take a tremendous amount of time and effort to reach other places in Shanghai. For instance, Hongqiao International Airport is a place where a lot of students will go when they go home. 

### Feature
- About user identity, we only allow students from Tongji to use our services, so we check users' identity by their matriculation numbers and password to prevent people who are not from our school using the system.

- Users join or create rooms in correspondence with their place of departure and place of destination, users with similar need can join in a same room at ease. In this way, the inconvenience of going out with peers can be resolved, and it can help save a lot of time and money.

- A credit evaluation system is collaborated with our platform to monitor users' behavior. We provide methods to reward, punish and even forbid relevant users according to their credit level.
